# Yihaa!

**Important: this app is still under development**

Eating healthy should be easy, naturally and above all, free! Your intelligent health assistant app is an open source project which should help people with their eating schedule. The app offers the ability to store recipes, keep track of your macros and micros and suggest recipes and/or foods which help you reach your goal. The project gives everyone the opportunity to contribute by offering Pull Requests and host it on their own machine/server. 

Let's create the 100% free go-to health app for our generation and the next.

## Suggesting foods using Discrete Optimization
Discrite optimization should offer a solution to suggest healthy recipes and/or foods to choose from, which will make sure you stay within your macros and micros for the day. This way you can have a random sandwich or snack during the day, without much trouble. If you add the snack or sandwich to the app, if possible, and Yihaa! tries to come up with recipes for the rest of the day which helps you to reach all your macros and micros.

## P2P recipe exchange
The project isn't hosted on a central platform, but you might want to exchange recipes with each other, for a number of reasons. Your database stays up-to-date with new recipes to choose from and you help others with your delicious recipes, just to name a few. The API will make two endpoints public, namely the one which offers your recipes to download by other users and the endpoint which provides a list of peers to connect to.
